## All molded parts

Sovol open sourced the design of the SV06 and all molded parts are available as STL and STEP files on their [GitHub](https://github.com/Sovol3d/SV06-Fully-Open-Source/tree/main/Molded%20Parts%20STL)

## SavageLau's upgrades

SavageLau upgraded some of the parts and put them on [Printables](https://www.printables.com/model/400638-sv06-printable-parts):

- Z Axis guide: The part is increased thickness to improve the rigidity
- 4010 fan duct: added a feature to redirect more flow to the extend part, which should give better cooling on the side. 
- Screen knob
- Extruder knob

## Screen mount plate

Remix of the original metal SOVOL SV06 screen mounting bracket adapted to be functional as a 3D printed part.
