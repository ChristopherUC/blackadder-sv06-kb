While SV06 uses proprietary nozzles, a Volcano style nozzle does fit but the dimensions are slightly different. Because of that you will need to make some adjustments.

## New Fan Vent

Replace the stock part cooling fan vent with [this 3D printed one](https://www.printables.com/model/418096-sv06-plus-fan-duct-regular-volcano) made by [FLYN INDUSTRIES](https://www.printables.com/@FLYNINDUSTRIES). Make sure to like the model and post a make.

This vent will help direct the air properly because the Volcano nozzle is shorter.

## Trim Silicone Sock

Slightly trim back the nozzle opening of the silicone sock. Don't overdo it, start small and adjust if its not enough. 

## Adjust ABL Probe

Adjust the ABL probe in the probe holder upwards to set your new Z offset correctly.
